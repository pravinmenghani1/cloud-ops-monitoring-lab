# Demo Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CPU Alarm Not Triggering Despite 100% CPU Usage

**Problem**: CPU alarm threshold was too high (80%) and evaluation period too long (2 periods of 5 minutes)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced CPU alarm threshold from 80% to 70%
- Reduced evaluation periods from 2 to 1
- Reduced period from 300 seconds to 60 seconds
- Added `treat_missing_data = "breaching"` for faster triggering
- Added `ok_actions` for recovery notifications

**File Modified**: `monitoring.tf`

### 2. RUM Not Showing Updated EC2 IP

**Problem**: RUM configuration had hardcoded IP address instead of dynamic EC2 IP

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed `domain = "54.80.210.131"` to `domain = aws_instance.docker_nginx.public_ip`
- Increased `session_sample_rate` from 0.1 to 1.0 for better demo visibility
- Added more favorite pages for better tracking

**File Modified**: `monitoring.tf`

### 3. No X-Ray Traces Showing

**Problem**: X-Ray integration was not properly configured and no test traces were being generated

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced X-Ray daemon configuration in user data
- Reduced metrics collection interval from 60 to 30 seconds
- Added X-Ray test script (`/opt/test-xray.sh`) that generates sample traces
- Improved X-Ray logging configuration

**Files Modified**: `user_data_enhanced.sh`

### 4. No Latency Demonstration for Traces

**Problem**: No endpoints existed to demonstrate latency and tracing

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created `/api/slow.html` endpoint that takes 3 seconds to load
- Created `/api/error.html` endpoint that randomly generates errors
- Created `/api/test.html` endpoint optimized for RUM tracking
- Added traffic generation script (`/opt/generate-traffic.sh`)

**File Modified**: `ssm_enhanced.tf` (new SSM document: `SetupDemoTools`)

### 5. Memory and Custom Alarms Not Triggering Easily

**Problem**: Thresholds were too high for demo purposes

**Fixes Applied**:
- Reduced memory alarm threshold from 85% to 75%
- Reduced custom error rate threshold from 10 to 3 errors
- Reduced custom response time threshold from 2.0 to 1.0 seconds
- Reduced all evaluation periods to 1 for faster triggering
- Reduced all periods to 60 seconds for faster detection

**Files Modified**: `monitoring.tf`, `enhanced_monitoring.tf`

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Demo Tools

**New SSM Document**: `SetupDemoTools`
- CPU stress testing script (`/opt/stress-cpu.sh`)
- Memory stress testing script (`/opt/stress-memory.sh`)
- Web traffic generation script (`/opt/generate-traffic.sh`)
- X-Ray tracing test script (`/opt/test-xray.sh`)

### 2. Latency Simulation Endpoints

**New Web Endpoints**:
- `/api/slow.html` - Simulates 3-second response time
- `/api/error.html` - Randomly generates client-side errors
- `/api/test.html` - Optimized for RUM tracking with user interactions

### 3. Enhanced Nginx Configuration

**Improvements**:
- Better logging format with response times
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Nginx status endpoint (`/nginx_status`)
- Custom error pages
- Gzip compression enabled
- Response time headers

### 4. Comprehensive Demo Instructions

**Added to README**:
- Step-by-step demo instructions for all monitoring features
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Expected timelines for alarm triggering
- Console URLs for easy access
- Sample email alert formats
- Demo success criteria checklist

## Configuration Changes

### CloudWatch Agent
- Reduced metrics collection interval from 60 to 30 seconds
- Enhanced log collection for better monitoring

### X-Ray Daemon
- Improved configuration for better trace collection
- Added proper logging setup
- Created test scripts for trace generation

### Alarm Thresholds (Optimized for Demo)
- CPU: 80% → 70%
- Memory: 85% → 75%
- Error Rate: 10 → 3 errors
- Response Time: 2.0s → 1.0s
- Evaluation Periods: 2 → 1
- Period Duration: 300s → 60s

## Files Modified

1. **monitoring.tf** - Fixed CPU alarm and RUM configuration
2. **enhanced_monitoring.tf** - Fixed all alarm thresholds for demo
3. **user_data_enhanced.sh** - Enhanced X-Ray and monitoring setup
4. **ssm_enhanced.tf** - Added demo tools SSM document
5. **README.md** - Added comprehensive demo instructions

## Expected Demo Results

After applying these fixes, the demo should show:

1. **CPU Alarm**: Triggers within 1-2 minutes of stress test
2. **Memory Alarm**: Triggers within 1-2 minutes of memory stress
3. **RUM Data**: Shows correct EC2 IP and user interactions
4. **X-Ray Traces**: Displays service map and individual traces
5. **Custom Metrics**: Error rate and response time alarms trigger easily
6. **Email Notifications**: Sent for all alarm state changes
7. **Recovery Notifications**: Sent when alarms return to OK state

## Deployment Instructions

To apply these fixes:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/pravinmenghani/Documents/mon-cfgmgmt

# Apply the updated configuration
terraform apply

# Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

# Verify instance is ready
aws ssm describe-instance-information --filters "Key=PingStatus,Values=Online"

# Run the demo following the instructions in README.md
```

This comprehensive set of fixes addresses all the identified issues and provides a robust demonstration environment for cloud monitoring and observability features.
